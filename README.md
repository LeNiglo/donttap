# DontTap Like MouseAimTrainer

## Installation

Just clone the repository, no dependency, nothing, just plain browser JS.

## Hosted version

- http://54.37.157.128/donttap/

## Running

You can use any way you want to open the index.html, you can simply double click on it, or my favorite way :

```
npx http-server 
```

If you want to make it accessible worldwide for a moment, use ngrok or similar

```
npx ngrok http 8080
```

(where 8000 is the port your http server is using)

## Thanks

Have fun and I am open to any suggestion or enhancement in the issues !
